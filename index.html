			<p><span class="styled-text0">Howard Ting</span> - Twenty-four, Taiwanese-American, male, second-generation, military whose current life activities consist primarily of reading, writing, sleeping, learning, exercising, piano-playing and software-engineering.</p>

			<p><span class="styled-text0">Reading</span> - My favorite works of literature are usually narratives that focus on the study of human character, values and psychology. In my experience, the most captivating stories are ones that encapsulate themes of sacrifice, humanism and hope against varying depths of both internal and external adversities. I read as much fiction as I can get away with.</p>

			<p><span class="styled-text0">Writing</span> - I love to write character studies. These are usually snippets of human characters and motivations that are a reflection of what I've observed of the human psyche. Many of my characters are projections of different aspects of people I know (if I know you, you're probably a character. :)) To uncover these characters and then to thrust them into a fictional reality is an activity I find to be both liberating and enjoyable.</p>

			<p><span class="styled-text0">Piano</span> - I taught myself how to play the piano and have been playing for a little over a decade now. My playlist is a rotation of sets of piece. Beethoven, Liszt and Chopin are the classical composers whose pieces I play most often. Some of my favorite musical themes come from video games I've played (e.g. Undertale, Legend of Zelda, Maplestory)</p>

			<p><span class="styled-text0">Tech</span> - As my field of study and source of income, tech is an inescapable subject. My primary involvement is in data science, where I use software tools to analyze and visualize clusters of data; computer science with specialization in machine learning. One of my favorite devices to play with is the Raspberry Pi. It's a tiny computer that can be programmed to do many things (e.g. security feed and related functionalities.) It can even run tensor-flow for object recognition (big surprise!)</p>
